title: Silex v3 kick off
description: Silex website builder is about to walk on no-code giants toes, with JAMStack/static/serverless
  tech as its core.
text: '<h1>Silex v3 kick off</h1><p>Silex website builder v1 was released as open
  source in 2009 and download a million times, then silex v2 in 2010 was made an online
  tool and then a downloadable app again. It is time in 2022 for the v3. Every major
  release means a complete rewrite with new tech, no backward compatibility, a new
  paradigm. This time we''re doing a free and open source alternative to Webflow.</p><h2>What
  is in the v3</h2><p>I (Alex Hoyau) have been the lead dev in all versions, I wrote
  90% of it''s code and I hold the vision - 2009 was before wix, 2010 was before no-code.
  This time I envision Silex as the bridge between 2 worlds: no-code and JAMStack/static/serverless.
  It will offer as a free and open source software (MPL) all the key features of Webflow
  with these components:</p><p>1. A drag and drop web design tool, showing all the
  CSS features in a class-based style manager - that is the no-code part</p><p>2.
  An integration with any graphql headless CMS - such as strapi and tinacms, to visually
  design your website with real data</p><p>3. Components to write liquid templates
  so that we can create Jekyll or eleventy websites</p><p>That is the plan, in that
  order.</p><h2>Motivations</h2><p>My motivations</p><p>* SL mission</p><p>* A world
  of open software</p><p>* Internet 2000, green websites</p><p>* Make Silex development
  more active, involve companies such as i2k</p><h2>Get on board</h2><p>What now?</p><p>*
  Discuss ideas and make sure it will be a tool you can use: Twitter #silex, GitHub
  forums</p><p>* Support by sharing</p><p>* Give money</p><p>* Give time</p><h2>Tech
  choices</h2><p>Philosophy</p><p>* Works with defaults, then use config to override
  defaults</p><p>* The website config file overrides all paths</p><p>* The website
  config overrides the blocks, so that we may have templates with nextjs/react and
  others with vue or tailwind</p><p>UI</p><p>* Right side panel, everything related
  to current selection</p><p>* Left side panel, everything related to the website</p><p>*
  Top bar, the "view" menu</p><p>Dashboard</p><p>* As simple as possible, no choice
  of a folder, store in default location + config</p><p>Templates</p><p>They are just
  a normal website with a config file to override Silex defaults. No possible update
  of a template after you started modifying it, no way to apply another template afterwards.</p><p>External
  site import</p><p>Thanks to grapesjs, it may be possible in the log run to import
  any HTML page in a page of your website, to be developed.</p>'
