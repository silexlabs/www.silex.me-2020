title: Silex v3 kick off
description: Silex website builder is about to walk on no-code giants toes, with JAMStack/static/serverless
  tech as its core.
text: '<h1>Silex v3 kick off</h1><p>Silex website builder v1 was released as open
  source in 2009 and download a million times, then silex v2 in 2010 was made an online
  tool and then a downloadable app again. It is time in 2022 for the v3. Every major
  release means a complete rewrite with new tech, no backward compatibility, a new
  paradigm. This time we''re doing a free and open source alternative to Webflow.</p><h2>What
  is in the v3</h2><p>I (Alex Hoyau) have been the lead dev in all versions, I wrote
  90% of it''s code and I hold the vision - 2009 was before wix, 2010 was before no-code.
  This time I envision Silex as the bridge between 2 worlds: no-code and JAMStack/static/serverless.
  It will offer as a free and open source software (MPL) all the key features of Webflow
  with these components:</p><ol><li><p>A drag and drop web design tool, showing all
  the CSS features in a class-based style manager - that is the no-code part</p></li><li><p>An
  integration with any graphql headless CMS - such as strapi and tinacms, to visually
  design your website with real data</p></li><li><p>Components to write liquid templates
  so that we can create Jekyll or eleventy websites</p></li></ol><p>That is the plan,
  in that order.</p><h2>Motivations</h2><p>My motivations</p><ul><li><p>SL mission</p></li><li><p>A
  world of open software</p></li><li><p>Internet 2000, green websites</p></li><li><p>Make
  Silex development more active, involve companies such as i2k</p></li></ul><h2>Get
  on board</h2><p>What now?</p><ul><li><p>Discuss ideas and make sure it will be a
  tool you can use: Twitter #silex, GitHub forums</p></li><li><p>Support by sharing</p></li><li><p>Give
  money</p></li><li><p>Give time</p></li></ul><h2>Tech choices</h2><p>Philosophy</p><ul><li><p>Works
  with defaults, then use config to override defaults</p></li><li><p>The website config
  file overrides all paths</p></li><li><p>The website config overrides the blocks,
  so that we may have templates with nextjs/react and others with vue or tailwind</p></li></ul><p>UI</p><ul><li><p>Right
  side panel, everything related to current selection</p></li><li><p>Left side panel,
  everything related to the website</p></li><li><p>Top bar, the "view" menu</p></li></ul><p>Dashboard</p><ul><li><p>As
  simple as possible, no choice of a folder, store in default location + config</p></li></ul><p>Templates</p><p>They
  are just a normal website with a config file to override Silex defaults. No possible
  update of a template after you started modifying it, no way to apply another template
  afterwards.</p><p>External site import</p><p>Thanks to grapesjs, it may be possible
  in the log run to import any HTML page in a page of your website, to be developed.</p>'
