title: Silex v3 kick off
description: Silex website builder, open source no-code and JAMStack/static/serverless
text: '<p></p><blockquote><p>An article about the future of <a href="https://www.silex.me/"
  title="Silex website builder">Silex</a> by <a href="https://lexoyo.me/" title="Alex
  Hoyau">Alex Hoyau</a>, the official maintainer</p></blockquote><h1>Silex v3 kick
  off</h1><p>Silex website builder v1 was released as open source in 2009 and download
  a million times, then silex v2 in 2010 was made an online tool and a downloadable
  app. It is time in 2022 for the v3. Every major release means a major rewrite with
  new tech, no backward compatibility, a new paradigm. </p><p>Today I''m aiming at
  a free and open source alternative to Webflow, WordPress Elementor/Divi.</p><h2>What
  is in the v3</h2><p>I have been the dev behind all versions, I wrote 99% of the
  code and I have hold the vision from the start - and 2009 was before wix, 2010 was
  before no-code.</p><p>Today I envision Silex as the bridge between 2 worlds: <strong>no-code</strong>
  and <strong>JAMStack/static/serverless</strong>. It will offer as a free and open
  source software (MPL) all the key features of Webflow with these components:</p><ol><li><p>A
  drag and drop web design tool, showing all the CSS features in a class-based style
  manager - that is the no-code part</p></li><li><p>An integration with any graphql
  headless CMS - such as strapi and tinacms, to visually design your website with
  real data</p></li><li><p>Components to write liquid templates so that we can create
  Jekyll or eleventy websites</p></li></ol><p>That is the plan, in that order.</p><h2>Motivations</h2><p>My
  motivations</p><ul><li><p>SL mission</p></li><li><p>A world of open software</p></li><li><p>Internet
  2000, green websites</p></li><li><p>Make Silex development more active, involve
  companies such as i2k</p></li></ul><h2>Get on board</h2><p>What now?</p><ul><li><p>Discuss
  ideas and make sure it will be a tool you can use: Twitter #silex, GitHub forums</p></li><li><p>Support
  by sharing</p></li><li><p>Give money</p></li><li><p>Give time</p></li></ul><h2>Tech
  choices</h2><p>Philosophy</p><ul><li><p>Works with defaults, then use config to
  override defaults</p></li><li><p>The website config file overrides all paths</p></li><li><p>The
  website config overrides the blocks, so that we may have templates with nextjs/react
  and others with vue or tailwind</p></li></ul><p>UI</p><ul><li><p>Right side panel,
  everything related to current selection</p></li><li><p>Left side panel, everything
  related to the website</p></li><li><p>Top bar, the "view" menu</p></li></ul><p>Dashboard</p><ul><li><p>As
  simple as possible, no choice of a folder, store in default location + config</p></li></ul><p>Templates</p><p>They
  are just a normal website with a config file to override Silex defaults. No possible
  update of a template after you started modifying it, no way to apply another template
  afterwards.</p><p>External site import</p><p>Thanks to grapesjs, it may be possible
  in the log run to import any HTML page in a page of your website, to be developed.</p>'
