title: Silex v3 in 2023
description: Silex website builder, open source no-code and JAMStack/static/serverless
text: '<p>June 2021 &gt; This is an article about the future of <a href="https://www.silex.me/"
  title="Silex website builder">Silex</a> by <a href="https://lexoyo.me/" title="Alex
  Hoyau">Alex Hoyau</a>, the official maintainer of Silex since 2009</p><h1>Silex
  v3 in 2023</h1><p>Silex website builder v1 was released as open source in 2009 and
  download a million times, then silex v2 in 2010 was made an online tool and a downloadable
  app. It is time in 2022 for the v3. Every major release means a major rewrite with
  new tech, no backward compatibility, a new paradigm.</p><p>Today I''m aiming at
  a free and open source alternative to Webflow, WordPress Elementor/Divi.</p><h2>What
  is in the v3</h2><p>I have been the dev behind all versions, I wrote 99% of the
  code and I have hold the vision from the start - and 2009 was before wix, 2010 was
  before no-code.</p><p>Today I envision Silex as the bridge between 2 worlds: <strong>no-code</strong>
  and <strong>JAMStack/static/serverless</strong>. It will offer as a free and open
  source software (MPL) all the key features of Webflow with these components:</p><ol><li><p>A
  drag and drop web design tool, showing all the CSS features in a class-based style
  manager - that is the no-code part</p></li><li><p>An integration with any <a href="https://jamstack.org/headless-cms/"
  title="Headless CMS">headless CMS</a> - such as directus or strapi, to visually
  design your website with real data</p></li><li><p>Integration with <a href="https://jamstack.org/generators/"
  title="Static site generators">static site generators</a>: components which transparently
  generate snipets of templates <a href="https://ejs.co/" title="EJS template">(ejs</a>,
  <a href="https://liquidjs.com/" title="Liquidjs templates">liquidjs</a>, <a href="https://twig.symfony.com/"
  title="twig templates">twig</a>, ...) so that we can create Jekyll or eleventy layouts</p></li></ol><p>That
  is the plan, in that order.</p><h2>The Ambassador program</h2><p>I would love to
  create a small group of ambassadors, with regular meetups:</p><ul><li><p>Make sure
  we are all up to date with latest dev and silex knowledge</p></li><li><p>Grow the
  community</p></li><li><p>Make Silex sustainable</p></li></ul><p>Please apply for
  a seat at the new ambassador program: email me or ping me <a href="https://github.com/silexlabs/Silex/discussions"
  title="Silex forums">in the forums</a></p><h2>Motivations</h2><p>I''m a fan of webflow
  I admit ! But their pricing is a bit off and I want to be able to make sites with
  <strong>static / jamstack technology</strong></p><p>I also like being able to <strong>host
  websites and the app</strong> on my (green) server and have the code of my sites
  versioned with git.</p><p>I want to be able to <strong>invite any number of users
  without worrying</strong> about the cost, why would it be more expensive to have
  people accessing the website I am working on?</p><p>I will never again accept to
  have a tool of mine <strong>decomissioned or updated to a new version</strong>,
  making it impossible or painful for me to continue working on a client website.
  I want to be able to revert to a previous version, and to keep a per-website apps
  versions.</p><p>And finally I need to be sure that <strong>anything is possible</strong>
  with the tool I use for my clients. Wether I want to edit something in the UI, white
  label something or change the whole CMS for another product. This is me working
  on my tool, I don''t want to be charged more for my own time.</p><p>Open source
  gives you all that.</p><p>My other motivations</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.silexlabs.org/"
  title="Silex Labs organization">Silex Labs</a> or other NGOs need free tools</p></li><li><p><a
  href="https://internet2000.net/" title="Green websites">Internet 2000</a> need a
  self hostable hackable tool to create green websites</p></li><li><p>No code has
  serious <strong>alternatives for everything but Webflow</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>Bubble
  has <a href="https://alternativeto.net/software/appsmith/about/">Appsmith</a></p></li><li><p>Airtable

  with defaults, then use config to override defaults</p></li><li><p>The website config
  file overrides all paths</p></li><li><p>The website config overrides the blocks,
  so that we may have templates with nextjs/react and others with vue or tailwind</p></li></ul><p>UI</p><ul><li><p>Right
  side panel, everything related to current selection</p></li><li><p>Left side panel,
  everything related to the website</p></li><li><p>Top bar, the "view" menu</p></li></ul><p>Dashboard</p><ul><li><p>As
  simple as possible, no choice of a folder, store in default location + config</p></li></ul><p>Templates</p><p>They
  are just a normal website with a config file to override Silex defaults. No possible
  update of a template after you started modifying it, no way to apply another template
  afterwards.</p><p>External site import</p><p>Thanks to grapesjs, it may be possible
  in the log run to import any HTML page in a page of your website, to be developed.</p>'
